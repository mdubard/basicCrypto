# Basic Cryptology
TextbookRSA.java uses force to identify the message, that is, the number that fits the designated gcd. For more information on RSA, refer to http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/RSA.

Vigenere.java is given an encrypted phrase. It then identifies the phrase used to encode the original message by going through all possibilities, and stopping on the phrase that matches common frequency levels of letters used in the English language. (For example, a "decoded" message with many q's and z's would most likely be wrong.)
